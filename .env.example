# MongoDB Connection String
# Get this from MongoDB Atlas: Database > Connect > Connect your application
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/kamals-diary?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# IMPORTANT: If your password contains special characters, URL-encode them:
# @ → %40, # → %23, % → %25, etc.
# Example: password "P@ssw0rd!" becomes "P%40ssw0rd%21"

# JWT Secret for authentication
# Generate a random string for production (e.g., using: openssl rand -base64 32)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. Replace <username>, <password>, and <cluster-url> with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials
# 2. If your password contains special characters, they must be URL-encoded:
#    @ -> %40
#    # -> %23
#    % -> %25
#    & -> %26
#    : -> %3A
# 3. Never commit .env.local or .env.production to version control
# 4. For production deployment (Vercel/Netlify), add this as an environment variable in your hosting platform

# Example:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://myuser:MyP%40ssw0rd@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/kamals-diary?retryWrites=true&w=majority
